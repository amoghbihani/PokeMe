        <p>The objective of the game is to poke the tiles which changes their color. You have to poke them before they timeout and become red. For every succesful poke you get one point and you lose one life when you miss a tile. You have got 3 lives to score as many points as you can!</p>
        <p>The game is broken into multiple stages. You proceed to next stage once you scored 10 points in it. The game becomes difficult as you progress to higher stages. The game ends when all lives are exhausted. So buckle up and poke ;)
